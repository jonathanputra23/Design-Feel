-------Tags and Layers------
**You will need to make a different Tag for each snap point type, such as Foundation_SnapPoints, Wall_SnapPoints.....
**Create a new layer for you preview gameobject. This is important and if you skip this step it will glich out 

--------SnapPoint--------
SphereCollider -> Radius = 0.25
SphereCollider -> IsTrigger = True

--------Prefab-----------
-Just add a material so it stands out(if using a primitive)
-No tag
-No layer

--------Preview GameObject--------
Layer -> Set it to somthing like BuildLayer(or whatever you want it to be)
Box Collider -> IsTrigger = True
Rigidbody -> useGravity = False
Rigidbody -> isKinematic = true
Add the Preview Script
